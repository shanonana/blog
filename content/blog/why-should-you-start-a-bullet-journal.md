I don't use this phrase lightly, so I mean it when I say: the bullet journal changed my life.  As someone with a ton of to-do's, multiple calendars/jobs, and limited free time, bullet journaling has kept me focused and organized during my busiest times.  And if something does slip through the cracks, it's usually when I was slacking on updating my journal.

There are a ton of ways to organize a bullet journal.  It can be intimidating to start; I am incredibly guilty of putting things off just because I'm waiting for the right moment to sit down and spend enough time and thought with it.  Bullet journaling can seem like a large task when you look at some of the incredible spreads people create. The inventor of the bullet journal, Ryder Carrol, has set up an intuitive system for tracking, organizing, and planning.  Learn more about his methods at [http://bulletjournal.com.](http://bulletjournal.com. "http://bulletjournal.com.")  Though his vision is lovely and incredibly efficient for many people, it may not be for everyone.  When starting a bullet journal, the most important thing to remember is to keep it simple and do what makes sense to you.  The last thing you want is to get discouraged trying to follow a system you don't completely understand or buy into yet.

Mine was pretty bare-bones when I started, but I have come to love the more creative aspects of journaling. I love having the freedom to design whichever layout I prefer, with whatever decorative flair inspires me at the time.  That's a huge part of my motivation to keep utilizing the functionality of the journal, which then translates to a well-organized life off the pages.

My SO started bullet journaling about 3 years ago, and convinced me to do the same. He has stuck with a more utilitarian approach - no bells and whistles, silly drawings, nor decorations along the margins.  But his method is incredibly effective for him and he uses his journal every day.  He has gone through about 5 journals and has modified his journal layout only a handful of times.  In those 3 years, I have started and stopped journaling numerous times.  And when I look back and consider my levels of stress, drive and focus, and productivity across that time, I can almost certainly link those feelings to whether or not I was utilizing my bullet journal. When I'm not journaling, things start to spin out of control.  I miss appointments, pay my bills late or barely on time, or veer off course from goals I was once so passionate about.  But when I am journaling, I have a sense of purpose and priority every day.  I have structure, which reduces my stress and anxiety.  I track my habits, and try to hold onto the good ones, with visual input of how my choices are shaping my life.

Ghandi said "Be congruent, be authentic, be your true self."  Using the bullet journal isn't just about making to-do lists or staying organized, at least not for me.  It's about reflecting on the things I've done, really examining my triumphs and failures, and taking ownership of my life and of my decisions every day.
